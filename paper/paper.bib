  abstract = {To guarantee that the results data of life science experiments align with the FAIR guidelines, proper metadata annotation of the experimental outcomes is crucial. The widely accepted metadata annotation format for this field is the ISA framework. However, achieving FAIR-compliant annotation of life science experiments is currently hindered by several challenges. The manual generation of ISA-compliant metadata is labor-intensive and prone to errors due to the complexity of ISA itself and the heterogeneous nature of the datasets derived from experiments. Additionally, researchers conducting life science related experiments often lack expertise in utilizing metadata schemas and related ontology concepts. Existing software libraries for the programmatic generation of ISA-compliant metadata are not easily usable by most researchers withoutsignificant programming skills and a deep understanding of ISA and its serialization formats ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON. Existing software with graphical user interfaces for these application areas are difficult to use without domain-specific expert knowledge. To address these issues, we are developing an intuitive and user-friendly tool called “ISA-Wizard”, a domain-agnostic successor to the MIAPPE-Wizard [@citesAsAuthority:miappewizard]. This web application can assist users in creating ISA-compliant metadata for the resulting datasets of their experiments. The ISA wizard provides a step-by-step questionnaire-based process for data entry with content recommendations and ontology term suggestions. Through comprehensive JSON-based configuration features it will ensure adherence to ISA-compliance and domain-specific minimal information checklists. Users are able to export and save the generated metadata files as ISA-JSON. We will also offer the capability to generate and publish FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) by leveraging the ARC-concept of the NFDI consortium DataPLANT and their PLANTdataHUB infrastructure [@citesAsAuthority:Weil2023] by using their software libraries and REST APIs.During BioHackathon Germany we wanted to find collaborators from various life science domains to create domain-specific and experiment-specific configuration files for ISA Wizard instances that could serve as configuration receipts and proof of concept of the generic capabilities of the wizard. By developing a user-friendly web application with interoperability features, we aimed to promote the adoption of FAIR principles and enhance data accessibility and reusability in the life science communities within de.NBI, ELIXIR, NFDIs and beyond.}

abstract = {SUMMARY In modern reproducible, hypothesis-driven plant research, scientists are increasingly relying on research data management (RDM) services and infrastructures to streamline the processes of collecting, processing, sharing, and archiving research data. FAIR (i.e., findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) research data play a pivotal role in enabling the integration of interdisciplinary knowledge and facilitating the comparison and synthesis of a wide range of analytical findings. The PLANTdataHUB offers a solution that realizes RDM of scientific (meta)data as evolving collections of files in a directory – yielding FAIR digital objects called ARCs – with tools that enable scientists to plan, communicate, collaborate, publish, and reuse data on the same platform while gaining continuous quality control insights. The centralized platform is scalable from personal use to global communities and provides advanced federation capabilities for institutions that prefer to host their own satellite instances. This approach borrows many concepts from software development and adapts them to fit the challenges of the field of modern plant science undergoing digital transformation. The PLANTdataHUB supports researchers in each stage of a scientific project with adaptable continuous quality control insights, from the early planning phase to data publication. The central live instance of PLANTdataHUB is accessible at (https://git.nfdi4plants.org), and it will continue to evolve as a community-driven and dynamic resource that serves the needs of contemporary plant science.}

  abstract = {Summary Enabling data reuse and knowledge discovery is increasingly critical in modern science, and requires an effort towards standardising data publication practices. This is particularly challenging in the plant phenotyping domain, due to its complexity and heterogeneity. We have produced the MIAPPE 1.1 release, which enhances the existing MIAPPE standard in coverage, to support perennial plants, in structure, through an explicit data model, and in clarity, through definitions and examples. We evaluated MIAPPE 1.1 by using it to express several heterogeneous phenotyping experiments in a range of different formats, to demonstrate its applicability and the interoperability between the various implementations. Furthermore, the extended coverage is demonstrated by the fact that one of the datasets could not have been described under MIAPPE 1.0. MIAPPE 1.1 marks a major step towards enabling plant phenotyping data reusability, thanks to its extended coverage, and especially the formalisation of its data model, which facilitates its implementation in different formats. Community feedback has been critical to this development, and will be a key part of ensuring adoption of the standard.},
